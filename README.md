# Coding Bootcamp Term 2 - Ruby on Rails Sample Blog

My First Rails Application from [Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
### What is "Ruby on Rails"?
Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.

Installing Rails
----------------
1. Check Ruby Version

   First, check if you already have Ruby installed. Open the command prompt and type `ruby -v`. 
   If Ruby responds, and if it shows a version number at or above 2.2.2, then type gem --version. If you don't get an error, skip Install    Ruby step. Otherwise, we'll install a fresh Ruby.⋅⋅
2. Install Ruby

   If Ruby is not installed, then download an installation package from [Ruby Installer Site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).      Follow the download link, and run the resulting installer.⋅⋅
3. Install Rails

   With Rubygems loaded, you can install all of Rails and its dependencies using the following command through the command line:
   ```
   gem install rails
   ```
